# Gem TD+ Settings

As of Gem TD+ 1.5.0 there are no selectable settings.  This may change in
future versions.

## HostBot Command Library (HCL)

In versions prior to Gem TD+ 1.5.0, a value of `0` would represent the default
setting for each available category.  This will continue to remain the case.
However, as there are no settings now it serves no functional purpose.
