# Map File Changes

Under each map version (the latest being listed first) are any changes that
were applied to it to get the next version.

Note that with the support of [Grim Extension Pack] [issue-30] it wil be
posslbe to handle and track changes to the map files in a more programmatic
fashion.  One notable shortcoming of this pack is the inability to remove
objects from the map directly.
