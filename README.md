# Gem Tower Defense Plus

Gem TD+ is an updated version of the original Gem Tower Defense created by
Bryvx (Bryan K.).  Its primary purpose, for now, is to fix bugs and address
performance issues.

Currently Gem TD+ is maintained by NVS.  For more information and discussion
on the map, or to report bugs and other issues, see [the website] [1].

## The Plan

For the foreseeable future Gem TD+ will deal with bugs and performance
improvements.  However, at some point it would be nice to approach other
topics such as balancing or finding ways to increase the replay value of the
map.  In these cases it would be best if there was community involvement in
the process.  So please visit the map website and share your opinions.  Check
the [Issues] [2] area, and look under [Milestones] [3] for discussion focal
points.  Also check under the label [Category: Discussion] [4] for another
route to many topics.  Thanks.
