# Gem TD+: A Warcraft 3 Tower Defense

Gem TD+ is an updated version of the original Gem Tower Defense created by
Bryvx (Bryan K.).  Its primary purpose, for now, is to fix bugs and address
performance issues.

Currently Gem TD+ is maintained by NVS.  For more information and discussion
on the map, or to report bugs and other issues, visit [the website] [1].

## The Plan

The current plan is to approach the map in three phases:

01. Bug fixes, address glaring errors, and remove memory leaks.
02. Balancing without changing the current game too much.  This will require
    community feedback.
03. Perhaps attempt to increase the replay value of the map.  No real clue
    how to go about this just yet, but brainstorming as time goes on.
