# Gem TD

Currently approaching the map in three phases:

01. Bug fixes, address glaring errors, and remove memory leaks.
02. Balancing without changing the current game too much.  This will require
    community feedback.
03. Perhaps attempt to increase the replay value of the map.  No real clue
    how to go about this just yet, but brainstorming as time goes on.
