# Gem Tower Defense Plus

Gem TD+ is maintained by NVS and is an updated version of the original Gem
Tower Defense created by Bryvx (Bryan K.).

For general map discussion, or anything Gem related, please visit the [Gem TD+
forum].  For more development centric information and discussion, or to report
bugs and other issues, please see the [Gem TD+ repository].

## The Plan

For the foreseeable future Gem TD+ will primarily deal with bugs and
performance improvements.  However, at some point, it would be nice to
approach other topics such as balancing or finding ways to increase the replay
value of the map.  In these cases it would be best if there was community
involvement in the process, so please share your opinions.  Feel free to
discuss matters on the forum, or check the [Issues] area of the repository.
